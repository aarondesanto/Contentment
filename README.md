# Contentment
Garbage Content Generator

Syntax: $('element').contentment(char, word);

Characters and words are both numbers. If "char" and "word" are both specified, you will be given "word" number of words which are each "char" letters long.

To generate characters only and not words, simply pass "word" null.
